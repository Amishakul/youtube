1. useMemo hook -> increases the performance of the website. 

2. The `useMemo` hook in React is used to memoize (or remember, caches) the result of a calculation so that it doesn’t have to be recalculated every time the component re-renders. It's helpful when you want to optimize performance by avoiding expensive operations that don’t change often. 

In simple terms, it helps React remember the value of something so it doesn’t redo the work unnecessarily.

3. useMemo is used in case of heavy operations

4. useMemo caches the result(value) of calculation between re-renders

5. useCallback hook will cache the function between re-renders

6. UseRef -> wanted a value to get update but you don’t want to render it

7. ref is not like this => ref = 0 
8. But it is like this, ref = {current: 0} -> object

9. Ref doesn’t renders but it's value remains persistance behind the scenes.

10. Difference between Let, Ref and State

11. UseRef will hold the value between states
